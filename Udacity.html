    <b>HTML</b>

    <p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Languange</em> and is used to create Webpages.
      A HTML document contains text content which defines what you will see including, <em>text,video, images and etc</em>
       and how the webpages looks like.
       </p>

    <b>Tags and Elements</b>

     <p>
       HTML documents used elements to tell the browsers the type of each elements by using <b>TAGS</b></p>

       <p><b> Below are the example of tags i learned so far.</b> </p>

  <p>       
 < b > tag  = Makes the 'text' content <b>bold</b><br>
 < em > tag = Makes the 'text' content <em>italic</em><br>
 < p > tag =  defines a paragraph.<br>
 < span > tag = used to group <span>inline-elements</span> in a document.<br>
 < Strong > tag =  is a phrase tag. It defines <strong>important text</strong>. <br>
 < img > tag = defines an image in an HTML page , has two required attributes: <b><em>src and alt.</b></em> <br>
 < a > tag = defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another. <br>
 < br > tag = inserts a single line break.<br>
</p>

  <b>Inline Vs Block elements </b>
  <p> Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline.
<br>
    A <b>block-level</b> element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
    <br>
    An <b>inline</b> element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
